# OHAI! 😃

I'm Fredrik. I've been doing stuff on the web since the 90s, which means that I'm pretty old at this point and maybe I think you kids should get off my lawn. Or stay. Either one's fine, actually. I'm a tech-oriented designer that started designing more with HTML and CSS than with Photoshop back in the 2000s and I swore I would never write more than 10 lines of JavaScript in one sitting. Now I write way more JavaScript than ever before, but thanks to [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), I've never loved it more! 😍 Seriously, I keep looking for excuses to build and rebuild stuff using Svelte and SvelteKit. 😬

I keep writing things in Python as well, and I'm not entirely sure that's the best of ideas sometimes, but that doesn't stop me.
